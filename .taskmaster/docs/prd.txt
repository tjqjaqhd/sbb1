# Todo App - Full Stack Development & Testing

# Overview
A minimal but fully functional Todo application designed to demonstrate and test multiple development technologies and workflows. This project serves as a comprehensive testing ground for TaskMaster MCP, Playwright MCP, and various specialized development agents. The app solves the basic task management problem while showcasing modern full-stack development practices.

**Target Users:** Developers testing MCP integrations and task management workflows
**Value:** Provides a complete end-to-end development experience from backend to frontend to automated testing

# User Experience

## User Personas
**Primary User:** Development teams testing MCP and agent workflows
**Secondary User:** Developers learning full-stack development patterns

## Key User Flows
1. **Add Todo Flow:**
   - Enter todo text in input field
   - Click add button or press Enter
   - See new todo appear in list
   - Input field clears automatically

2. **Manage Todo Flow:**
   - Click checkbox to toggle completion
   - See visual status change (strikethrough, styling)
   - Click delete button to remove item
   - Confirm deletion if needed

3. **Filter/View Flow:**
   - Use filter buttons to show All/Active/Completed
   - View real-time statistics counter
   - Experience smooth transitions and feedback

# Technical Architecture

## Frontend Stack
- **Framework:** Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks for simplicity)
- **Styling:** Modern CSS with Flexbox/Grid
- **HTTP Client:** Fetch API for backend communication
- **Build:** No build process required (direct file serving)

## Backend Stack (COMPLETED)
- **Server:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Data Storage:** In-memory array (development-focused)
- **API Style:** RESTful with JSON responses
- **Middleware:** CORS, JSON parsing, static file serving
- **Port:** 3000 (configurable via environment)

## Integration Points
- Frontend communicates with backend via HTTP REST API
- Static files served from /public directory via Express
- API calls use standard JSON format
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
**Risk:** Frontend-backend integration issues
**Mitigation:** Use existing working API endpoints, implement proper error handling

**Risk:** Playwright setup complexity
**Mitigation:** Start with basic tests, incrementally add complexity

**Risk:** Cross-browser compatibility issues
**Mitigation:** Use standard web APIs, avoid browser-specific features

## MVP Scope Definition
**Risk:** Feature creep beyond testing objectives
**Mitigation:** Focus on core CRUD functionality, add enhancements only after core completion

**Risk:** Over-engineering for a test application
**Mitigation:** Keep solutions simple and maintainable, prioritize functionality over complexity
